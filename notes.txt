Restful API
REST- Representational State Transfer
Transfer Data around
Alt- to traditional web page, where webpage doesnt fit needs

Client is browser then Server
Client sends request to server then response to client
40 different pages sent
Dynamically re-render the page

What happens when we reach out to server but dont need html
Server running 
Mobile app
Mobile app needs to store and fetches data but does not render html
If client is some code wants to access third party features eg google location api
Finall client browswer, only for first request- store and fetches data but never renders a second HTML page
RESTful APIs are Stateless Backends
Client and RESTful Server (API)
/users - GET POST Delete
/posts GET POST PATCH
/products GET

Client can send AJAX request and then get back a response to re-render the DOM

Have server submitting different requests

Response is submitted in JSON data, not limited to JSON but not sending HTML data
All these urls are sent from javascript or equivalent for a mobile act
Dont want html want the data
